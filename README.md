# Data Source
Customer Churn Dataset : This dataset is from PwC Switzerland Virtual Internship Program offered by Forage, which contains Gender distribution, Tenure , Internet service, online security,Tech support, Contract Type, Payment Method, etc.

# Tools Used
PowerBI - Creating Dashboards, Data Visualization

# Data Preparation
Here's a quick rundown of the steps I took in the project:

1Ô∏è] Data Preparation: Ensured the data was clean, organized, and ready for analysis.

2Ô∏è] Data Modeling: Structured the data for effective analysis using Power BI.

3Ô∏è] Data Analysis (DAX): Leveraged DAX functions to dig deep into the numbers.

4Ô∏è] Data Visualization (Dashboard): Created visually compelling dashboards to make complex data easily understandable.

5Ô∏è] Insights: Unearthed some fascinating findings!

Insights
1Ô∏è] Overview :

‚Ä¢ Total customers are 7043 with number of retained customers is 5174 & customers churned are 1869.

‚Ä¢ The rate of retained customers is 73.46% & the rate of churned customers is 26.54%, amounting to $16.06M yearly charges and $456.12K monthly charges.

‚Ä¢ 2955 tech tickets and 3632 admin tickets opened.

‚Ä¢ There are about 16.21% customers who are senior citizens & percentage of senior citizens in churned customers is 25.46%.

2Ô∏è] Demographics :

‚Ä¢Churn rate is higher for customers who have opted for Internet Services. Customers with Fiber Optic services have higher churn rate that is 69.39%.

‚Ä¢ Average Tenure of customers is 32.37% & Average Tenure of churned customers is 17.89.

‚Ä¢ It is observed that, customers with low tenure are churned more.

3Ô∏è] Subscription :

‚Ä¢ Tech support should be improved more.

‚Ä¢ Company should focus on customers with shorter customers ass they are more likely to be churned.

‚Ä¢ As the churn rate is higher for internet services in fiber optic, telecom company should focus more on retaining those customers and improve in that area.

‚Ä¢ Customers should be subscribed to more services & plans with longer tenures which are offered by the company's.

Recommendations:
Based on the analysis, here are some actionable recommendations:

Encourage customers to subscribe to One-Year and Two-Year contracts, offering incentives to mitigate the higher monthly costs.
Implement targeted discounts for Month-to-Month subscribers to enhance retention.
Educate customers on the benefits of signing up for Online Security and Tech Support to improve service stickiness.
Aim to increase the sale of 1 and 2-year contracts by 5% each and boost yearly automatic payments by 5%.
